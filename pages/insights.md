# Insights from proposals

### Explore proposals submitted to Beehive over five years

The analysis below explores the proposals submitted to Beehive between 2016 and 2020.
Results have been anonymised to avoid identifying specific organisations or projects.

Where possible the results have been compared to data from [360Giving](https://threesixtygiving.org/) publishers on grants made,
or to figures from the [NCVO UK Civil Society Almanac 2020](https://data.ncvo.org.uk/) looking at the whole charity sector.

You can <a href="/results.json">download the full results</a> in JSON format to explore them yourself.
