                The Shared Ground Fund will provide organisations with the
                financial support they need to test new approaches, explore ways
                of exploiting emerging opportunities and address new challenges
                in this area of great change and uncertainty. It will also
                support organisations with an already strong track record of
                achievement with substantial help to achieve a greater impact.
              </p>

              <p>
                Applicants must contribute to one of the following aims of the
                Shared Ground Fund:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Staying safe – ensuring that young people who have migrated
                  can address the significant barriers that affect their ability
                  to thrive
                </li>
                <li>
                  Living well together – supporting work which helps communities
                  experiencing high levels of migration become stronger and more
                  connected
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                The Shared Ground Fund offers two kinds of grants to support
                organisations at different stages of development:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Shared Ground ‘explore and test’ grants – each year the funder
                  expects to make around 10 grants to help explore and test new
                  approaches and ways of addressing new challenges (awards will
                  be for a maximum of £60,000, usually for up to two years)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Shared Ground ‘more and better’ grants – each year the funder
                  expects to make around 10 longer, larger grants to help
                  develop and embed more established activities (awards will be
                  for between £100,000 and £400,000 for up to four years). They
                  expect most grants to be in the range of £100,000 – £250,000.
                  Larger grants will be considered on an exceptional basis and
                  usually by invitation.

                Enable grants are awarded to charities which have identified

                organisational improvements, development of areas such as
                leadership and governance, improved systems and demonstrating
                outcomes. These developments put charities in a stronger
                position to better deliver services and attract funding.

                For application of £100,000 or more. These are reviewed at one
                of the Foundation’s eight Board meetings a year and are
                carefully planned in advance to be fair to all applicants. If
                you are considering applying for a major grant, please start by
                sending a one page summary
                outlining what you are raising funds for, the total cost and
                fundraising target. We can give you bespoke guidance on whether
                you are eligible. Please note that if you are applying for
                £100,000 or more we typically expect your project and/or annual
                income to be in excess of £1 million. Please do not apply for a
                major grant through our website.

                The Foundation aims to improve the quality of life for people
                throughout the UK by supporting work that focuses on the arts,
                children and young people, the environment, food and social
                change. Applicants should apply for the amount that they need.
                The Foundation does not set limits and makes grants across a
                fairly wide spectrum of sizes. However, the Foundation rarely
                makes grants that are smaller than £5,000 and it makes only a
                small number of grants in excess of £500,000. It is unusual for
                the Foundation to give a grant of this size or larger to an
                organisation with which it does not already have a relationship.
                Funding is available for core or project costs, and this
                includes staff salaries and overheads.
