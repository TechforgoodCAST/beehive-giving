# About

Beehive was a free funding suitability checking tool that used a funder’s guidelines, priorities and open data to produce a report that helped fund seekers decide where to apply.

In a study in June 2018, more than 90% of Beehive users avoided funders they were inappropriate for, or adapted their proposal to make it suitable – saving them time and the wasted effort of applying for the wrong funding opportunity.

### Who was behind Beehive?

Beehive was an open source tool developed and maintained by [CAST](https://wearecast.org.uk/). It was originally founded by the foundation of a group of tech companies in 2014 and has been supported by a number of funders such as the [National Lottery Community Fund](https://www.tnlcommunityfund.org.uk/), working closely with partners like [360Giving](https://www.threesixtygiving.org/).

<!-- TODO: add some key learning -->
<!-- ### A little more...

Through the course of developing Beehive we’ve learned a lot about the challenges faced by funders and fund seekers, as well as what it takes to create a valuable tech for good service. Now that Beehive is maturing we’ve taken some time to reflect on our journey and how digital can be used in charitable funding…

- Working on the right things at the right time
- Designing a valuable digital service
- Unlocking value from waste and grant-making data
- Funding needs, designing grant-making from within, and ‘impossible’ solutions
- Digitally-enabled funders, the future of grant-making (and Beehive) -->
