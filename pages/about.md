# About

Beehive was a free funding suitability checking tool that used a funder’s guidelines, priorities and open data to produce a report that helped fund seekers decide where to apply.

In a study in June 2018, more than 90% of Beehive users avoided funders they were inappropriate for, or adapted their proposal to make it suitable – saving them time and the wasted effort of applying for the wrong funding opportunity.

### Who was behind Beehive?

Beehive was an open source tool developed and maintained by [CAST](https://wearecast.org.uk/). It was originally founded by the foundation of a group of tech companies in 2014 and has been supported by a number of funders such as the [National Lottery Community Fund](https://www.tnlcommunityfund.org.uk/), working closely with partners like [360Giving](https://www.threesixtygiving.org/).

### Why was Beehive retired?

Major [development](https://github.com/TechforgoodCAST/beehive-giving/releases) on Beehive and funds to support it ended in 2018. With this in mind it was open sourced, [made free to use](https://www.threesixtygiving.org/2018/12/16/like-bees-to-honey/) and set up to operate with minimal maintainance. After almost two years of operating with minimal maintainance we noticed that the data and guidelines which Beehive used to provide it's service were out of date, and as such the checks it performed were potentially no longer relevant. With no funding available to update this data the decision was taken to retire the service.

<!-- ### A little more...

Through the course of developing Beehive we’ve learned a lot about the challenges faced by funders and fund seekers, as well as what it takes to create a valuable tech for good service. Now that Beehive is maturing we’ve taken some time to reflect on our journey and how digital can be used in charitable funding…

- Working on the right things at the right time
- Designing a valuable digital service
- Unlocking value from waste and grant-making data
- Funding needs, designing grant-making from within, and ‘impossible’ solutions
- Digitally-enabled funders, the future of grant-making (and Beehive) -->
