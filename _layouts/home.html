      Insights from using open data to provide a grant funding suitability
      checking tool
    </p>
    <p class="mb20">
      Beehive was a free funding suitability checking tool that used a funderâ€™s
      guidelines, priorities and open data to produce a report (<a
        href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/example.html %}"
        >example</a
      >) that helped fund seekers decide where to apply.
    </p>
    <p class="mb20">
      After checking well over 18,000 proposals from individuals and
      organisations seeking charitable funding Beehive was retired in September
      2020.
