      %p.mb20
        Beehive's approach is unique. We use data published by funders to the
        = succeed "." do
          = link_to '360Giving standard', 'http://www.threesixtygiving.org/', target: '_blank', class: 'blue'
        This is a data standard which allows funders to publish data about who they fund in a consistent and easy-to-use format.
      %p.mb20
        By publishing to this standard funders are committed to transparency about the organisations they fund, and it's in this spirit of transparency that Beehive uses this data. We don't display or republish the data directly, instead we use it to power a recommendation engine that compares proposals that charities have submitted to our site against projects that have already been funded, and matches those proposals to funders that we
      %p.mb20
        For us to use the data it needs to meet two criteria:
      %ol.pl30.mb20
        %li.mb5
          Be valid against the 360Giving data standard. This means that the data is correctly formatted, with the right column headings, date formats, etc.
        %li
          Be published under a licence that allows us to re-use it: generally this means no restrictions on using the data for commercial purposes (we are a registered charity, but we do charge for some premium features on Beehive).
      %p.mb20
        Our aim at Beehive is to make sure charities with impressive, interesting and impactful ideas can find the right funders to support and nurture those ideas. We want to make sure applicants find appropriate funders, and that funders are receiving applications that meet eligibility criteria and are appropriate for their funding: helping you direct your investments to have the most impact. Our end goal is for the lives of beneficiaries to be improved by connecting funders and applicants.
      %h4.mb20 What other data do you use?
      %p
        We also need a small amount of information about your fund, in order to display it properly to our users. This includes a title and description of the fund, as well as a series of characteristics relating to eligibility. We want to help applicants see which funds they are eligible for, and make sure they don't see funds that they don't meet the eligibility criteria for.

      %p.mb20
        We're excited about the possibilities that Beehive Giving offers funders. Currently the site gives applicants a chance to input information about a proposal and then check for fund recommendations and eligibility relating to that proposal. But we think there is potential for a lot more than this, including ideas like:
      %ul.list.pl30.mb20
        %li.mb5
          Fund analytics
        %li.mb5
          Allowing funders to see proposals
