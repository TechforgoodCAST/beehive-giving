      %p.mb20 Unless we obtain your permission, information that is identifiable as relating to you (i.e. it has not been edited to make it anonymous) is not shared with or sold to other organizations for commercial purposes, except in connection with the operation of the Beehive service (including matching users with other users, providing insights into the activities of Users and related research and publications), or under the following circumstances:

      %p.mb20 We use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website. A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a web site and stored on your computer's hard drive.

      %p Cookies are required to use the Beehive service. We use cookies to record current session information. If you continue without changing your browser settings, we'll assume that you are happy to receive all cookies on the Beehive website.

        %h3.light.py20#data-storage Data Storage

      %p.mb20 Beehive uses third-party vendors and hosting partners to provide the Beehive service. Data relating to Users and their organisations is transferred to or mirrored on servers within the European Union. Beehive reserves the right to transfer or mirror data to servers outside the European Union.

      %p.mb20 Beehive will apply all reasonable measures to ensure that data held on Beehive servers is secure but cannot guarantee that security measures will not be breached.
