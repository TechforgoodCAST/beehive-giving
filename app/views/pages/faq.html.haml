        %span.muted.year About
      %p Much like the humble honeybee we believe that social sector organisations are essential to healthy and productive communities, and that without them countless communities would be worse off.

        How much does Beehive cost?
        %span.muted.year About
      %p Nothing, a ‘basic’ account is free and always will be.
      %p We intend to introduce a ‘professional’ account type in the future that would be paid for, and extend the features available to you on Beehive. There would be no obligation to upgrade, and your ‘basic’ account privileges will not be affected.
      %p As Beehive is a tech for good project, all profits would be reinvested back into the development and running of the platform.
