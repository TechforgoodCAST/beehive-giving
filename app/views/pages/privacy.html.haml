      %p.mb20 When you register for Beehive we ask for information including your name, email address, organisation name, billing address, and payment information (Members who sign up for the free account are not required to enter any payment details). Once you have registered for Beehive you may also submit additional information relating to your funding activities or requirements, your other activities or objectives, or those of your organisation, and other relevant information.

      %p.mb20 Unless we obtain your permission, information that is identifiable as relating to you (i.e. it has not been edited to make it anonymous) is not shared with or sold to other organizations for commercial purposes, except in connection with the operation of the Beehive service (including matching users with other users, providing insights into the activities of Users and related research and publications), or under the following circumstances:

      %ul.list.pl30
        %li.mb5 If it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law.
        %li If we transfer information about you if Beehive is acquired by or merged with another organisation, other than an organisation established by us and controlled by us. In this event, Beehive will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
