      Describe how your organisation typically delivered its work for it's usual beneficiaries in
      = succeed '.' do
        = @profile.year || get_year
      For example, if you're a social business offering supported accommodation, accompanied with a drugs rehabilitation and employment programme where beneficiaries build furniture; you might select - 'Buildings/facilities', and 'Services', along with saying 'Yes' to the question about payment (as you happen to sell the furniture beneficiaries create).
    %p
      Finally, report the number of beneficiaries you've impacted with your typical offer of work in
      = succeed '.' do
        = @profile.year || get_year
      If you can't give precise figures please give an estimate and select the appropriate option, but avoid including 'vanity metrics' like the number of page views to your website, or visitors to a one off event you held.
