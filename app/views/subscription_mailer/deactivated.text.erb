Hi <%= @user&.first_name %>

Your 'Pro' subscription on www.beehivegiving.org (Beehive) has now come to an end.

As Beehive is a project of a charity, we really appreciate that you upgraded your account a year ago. Your contribution has helped us sustain the project and provide our grant funding suitability checking service to many more fund seekers - thank you!

We know there is plenty we could do to improve our service, and as a valued customer we'd love to ask you a few brief questions about this.

To say thank you for your feedback and support, we'll happily extend your 'Pro' subscription for another year (free of charge).

Just reply to this email and let us know you'd be happy to answer some questions.

Big thanks,
The Beehive Team
